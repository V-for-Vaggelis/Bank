#Bank project
The bank project is a C++ project simulating a bank's functionality. The project's purpose is practicing object oriented programming with C++. It was developed as part of the "programming languages" course during my first semester in the "computational Physics" master in AUTH. It consists of 3 main classes, "Bank", "Person" and "Account", and two subclasses "CheckingAccount" and "SavingsAccount" that inherit from the "Account" class and just charge with different interests.

##How to run
To run this project you will need a C++ compiler. Ideally dev C++ is suggested, it's where the project was developed.
